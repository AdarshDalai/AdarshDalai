# Adarsh Dalai

Writing code. Mostly Android (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose) and backend systems (Python/FastAPI). The goal is software that works, scales, and doesn't waste people's time.

---

### What I'm Doing Now:

* Currently wrestling with **Utter** â€“ a social platform concept. Using FastAPI for the backend, Supabase for data, and Jetpack Compose/SwiftUI for the frontends. Trying to make AI recommendations less useless (using T5/FAISS principles from previous work like **AppConnX**).
* Also built **Tasker**, an Android app using the Gemini API to see if AI could actually help organize tasks instead of just generating boilerplate. Jury's still out, but the code runs.

### Past Work That Didn't Explode:

* **Internship @ Ingenious-tech World:**
    * Built a modular Android auth UI with Jetpack Compose. Made it a library on JitPack because writing the same code twice is dumb. Apparently improved onboarding by 20% and cut redundancy by 30%. Fine.
    * Got a 3D panoramic viewer working using Google's Street View API and gyroscope data. It showed pictures in 3D.

### Tools I Use (Because they get the job done):

* **Languages:** Kotlin, Java, Python primarily. Swift, C, Javascript when necessary.
* **Frameworks:** Jetpack Compose, FastAPI. Have touched SwiftUI, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
* **Backend/Infra:** Docker, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase, AWS, Azure. Basically, whatever cloud or container thing makes sense for the problem.
* **AI/ML:** Messed with T5, FAISS, RAG, Gemini API. Practical applications, not just research papers.

### The Plan:

Keep building things. Get better at designing systems that don't fall over (microservices, maybe). Make the iOS side (SwiftUI) less painful. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
